# Facebook-Janitor
This open-source project consists of a client tool that automatically deletes Facebook activity. Its inspiration was found in another open-source project "DeleteFB" that is also currently under development by weskerfoot. His project repository can be found in https://github.com/weskerfoot/DeleteFB. The project by weskerfoot currently makes use of the facecbook home page and relies on a lot of its  UI components in order to delete Facebook activity automatically. Facebook's UI has been under constant revision and updates, which makes the entire project susceptible to change and thus less stable. This project will employ a similar approach to weskerfoot's, where the activity log of Facebook will be consulted as the main page for the automatic deletion of Facebook activity, rather than the user's homepage. This change implies a lot of changes in its original project, hence the start of a new open-source project.
